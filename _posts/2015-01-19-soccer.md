ND's endowment adds up to $10.7M--similar to that of, for instance, Columbia University in the City of New York. As you may already know, we are talking about two of the wealthiest institutions of higher education in the entire planet. And ND pays RLL MA students $12,500/year and $23,000/year for PhD students.
