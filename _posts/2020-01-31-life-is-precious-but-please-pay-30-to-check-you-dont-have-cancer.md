The first day of semester is supposed to be full of promise. But on this day, I'm panicking, because I need to get my partner a medical appointment. Since they show signs of cancer, I disregard the potential costs. I don't sleep that whole night. In every moment, I want to vomit. I don't actually have any money in my bank account, because my rent payments have wiped it out. The cost of rent is excessively high, and I barely have money to feed mt family - but it's worth it for an education... right?

Finally, we get the appointment and everything is okay. The relief that washes over us is quickly replaced with worry. We have to pay $30 to a receptionist before we can leave the building. Nobody explains why, or who will receive this money, or how it will be used. We have health insurance - I pay $2555 a year for my spouse to access medical care, but the providers will always want more. I have to use a credit card to pay the 30 bucks. It doesn't sound like a lot, but when you live on such a low income, $30 is the difference between eating and starving. $30 will help to buy antibiotics or contraception, so I don't bring a child into a world where I literally can't afford to pay for their existence. The receptionist insists on the payment, even after we awkwardly admit that we don't have that much money in our checking accounts. I guess I will find a way to pay for this, and all my credit card bills. But what choice do I have when it's between the prospect of cancer and debt? 

This is the first day of semester.
